This repository contains all of my writeups and journal entries for Physical Comp & Alt Interfaces (IGME-470). Each assignment is separated into separate folders for convenience.

## Assignment Prompts

### PComp Art
Find some digital/tangible interactive art (interpret loosely):
* Whodunnit, and how did they build it?
* What context is it aimed at (audience, locale, ...)?
* What kind of experience is created?

### Moarr Digital
* Create a circuit with 2 digital inputs and 2 digital LED outputs. What will the interaction be for controlling the LEDs? Add variables and program accordingly (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/). Feel free to get "interesting"/moaarrr with your digital inputs and outputs.
* Describe what you wanted to do, any discoveries/confusions, and what you actually did do, in your Physical Computing blog/journal.
* Include pictures and your code links. Cite used references/tutorials.

This repository contains all of my writeups and journal entries for Physical Comp & Alt Interfaces (IGME-470). Each assignment is separated into separate folders for convenience.

## Assignment Prompts

### PComp Art
Find some digital/tangible interactive art (interpret loosely):
* Whodunnit, and how did they build it?
* What context is it aimed at (audience, locale, ...)?
* What kind of experience is created?

### Moarr Digital
* Create a circuit with 2 digital inputs and 2 digital LED outputs. What will the interaction be for controlling the LEDs? Add variables and program accordingly (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/). Feel free to get "interesting"/moaarrr with your digital inputs and outputs.
* Describe what you wanted to do, any discoveries/confusions, and what you actually did do, in your Physical Computing blog/journal.
* Include pictures and your code links. Cite used references/tutorials.

### Blink
Goal: Show that you can make a simple interactive system with physical controls for a coherent, engaging experience. Your objective is to design and create interesting behavior in order to achieve that engagement, and document as you go. Your blog post (appropriate for general audiences) should include:
* statement of experience goal
* summary descriptive text
* narrative, issues, discoveries, results
* Process & result photos and video/s. Any video (with title and credits) should be linked and embedded in the blog post.
* circuit diagram/schematic
* code or link to code
* citation/s of any inspired-by work and clutch technical references

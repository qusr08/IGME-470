# Toaster Turret

*Toaster Turret* is a game about dodging sponges launched by a sentient toaster!

The toaster is rotated on its side with a motor/servo attached to the bottom of it. There will be distance sensors or cameras placed facing outward around the toaster, allowing the toaster to see the players' locations. All electronics are connected to an Arduino to give the toaster a mind. Players stand around the toaster within a specified range, where the range is dictated by how far the toaster can shoot a sponge.

During the game, the toaster will rotate and fire sponges at the players. If the player is hit with a sponge, they are out. If a player steps outside of the bounds of the game, they are also out. Once the toaster runs out of sponges, each player is allowed to go and pick up the songes to reload the toaster. The last player standing wins!

> [The Human Touch](https://github.com/qusr08/IGME-470/tree/main/Move/The%20Human%20Touch): The Unity project for The Human Touch

## My Goal
> For my project, I wanted to make an experience that showed humans' impact on nature. The Human Touch turns water cascading in a waterfall to trash, demonstrating how easy and careless humans pollute our planet.
